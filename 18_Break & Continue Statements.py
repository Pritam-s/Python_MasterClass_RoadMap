1. Break Statement -

    The break statement STOPS THE LOOP even if the while condition is satisfied.

    i.e. In short, it puts a break on the loop and doesn't allow to iterate further.
    

2. Continue Statement -

    The Continue statement STOPS THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THE LOOP and then continues with the next iteration.

    i.e. in short, it just stops the current iteration and not the whole loop. and also allows to continue with the further iteration.
